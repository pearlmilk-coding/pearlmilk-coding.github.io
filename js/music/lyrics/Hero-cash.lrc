[Verse 1]
I let my soul fall into you
I never thought I'd fall right through
I fell for every word you said
You made me feel I needed you
And forced my heart to think it's true
But I found I'm powerless with you

[Chorus]
Now I don't need your wings to fly
No, I don't need a hand to hold in mine this time
You held me down, but I broke free
I found the love inside of me
Now I don't need a hero to survive
Cause I already saved my life
Cause I already saved my life
[Verse 2]
I fell into your fantasy
But that's all our love will ever be
I lost hope in saving you and me
You think I'm lost, falling apart
But your lies just made a stronger heart
My life is just about to start

[Chorus]
Now I don't need your wings to fly
No, I don't need a hand to hold in mine this time
You held me down, but I broke free
I found the love inside of me
Now I don't need a hero to survive
Cause I already saved my life
Already saved my life
I already saved my life
Already saved my life
I already saved my life

[Chorus]
Now I don't need your wings to fly
No, I don't need a hand to hold in mine this time
You held me down, but I broke free
I found the love inside of me
Now I don't need a hero to survive
Cause I already saved my life
Already saved my life
I already saved my life
Already saved my life
I already saved my life

[Outro]
Now I don't need your wings to fly
